# X-Team NN Notify

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

Briefly describe a problem that your team would like to solve.  
Describe at a high level a program that could solve that problem.

Our problem is that we want a way to store all of our music into one playlist and have a variety of ways to playback these songs. We will used a linked list of song objects that will have information about the song like duration and artist. 

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)

Notify

2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce.  Include and example format of the output produced.

There are two main outputs, you can lookup a song title and get the relevant information on it, or we can give you a list of the songs in a playlist.

3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.

Song Title, Artist, Album Name, Duration

4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.

There will be a form that has text boxes where the user can put in all the information about the song. (Ex. text field for song title, artist, ext). After the user is done filling in all of the information, they can press submit and the song will be added to the playlist. There will also be buttons that have titles like print songs, lookup a specific song, or output the playlist in a certain way.

5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
